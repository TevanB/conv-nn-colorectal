# CSC413 Final Project - Exploring DenseNet-121 and Xception for Colorectal Tissue Classification in Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis

The notebooks folder has the code we used for our assigment in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.

The data folder has a copy of the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/colorectal-histology-mnist/code

Our code is based on the code from https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8099726, or more directly from https://github.com/liuzhuang13/DenseNet.

The dataset.py and main.py are the code samples that were migrated to Jupyter Notebook as we conducted our research for both models, to test our code you can skip to the notebooks folder.
